**RS6026: Open Science Practices in Remote Sensing (遙測開放科學實踐)**

Whyjay Zheng (鄭懷傑), whyjz@csrsr.ncu.edu.tw

## Course objectives

- Explore the open science practices that are or will be highlighted in our community. 
- Share our thoughts about open science and how to improve it for better science collaboration and communication. 
- Gain hands-on experience in open science through class discussion and term projects.

## Format

1. Tuesday 10:00 am - 11:50 am at R2-223-1 (for lectures and discussion)
2. Thursday 1:00 pm - 1:50 pm at R2-115  (mostly hands-on sessions)

The hands-on sessions (labeled 🛠️ in [Weekly topics](syllabus.html#weekly-topics)) are on Thursday and **require access to a computer**. You are welcome to use the computers available in R2-115 or bring your own.

As a class for open science, all written material presented in this class, including handouts, slides, and student term papers, will be available or posted online for public access. Your grade and all the sensitive information will remain private.

### Code of conduct

#### Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI)

- We will not tolerate any forms of discrimination and harassments during the class. 

- We encourage conversations about inequality whenever you sense that. This include but is not limited to [hidden curriculum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_curriculum) and [microaggression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microaggression). 

- Be respectful about different ideas and perspectives during discussion, and be mindful about your choice of words. 

#### Attribution of work

- Be careful about using the copyrighted material, and make sure you have the permission/license with proper attribution whenever using it.

- Do not work with other students for the term project; it must be your sole work unless the instructor gives you permission to do so.

## Grading

Your grade is entirely based on the class project and is divided into four components: 

- progress report (write-up): 10%
- progress report (oral presentation): 20%
- final report (oral presentation): 30%
- final report (write-up): 40%

The class attendance won't affect your final grade except for two oral presentation sessions (**11/4** and **12/9**; see [Late work policy](late-work-policy)).

(late-work-policy)=
### Late work policy

- Write-ups: 10% penalty will be applied for each day past the deadline. 
- Oral presentations: If you are absent on the date of oral presentation, we accept video recordings (shared within the class) as a make-up. However, 20% penalty will be applied for each day past the presentation date. 
- The policies above may be exempted under special circumstances, such as family emergency or urgent medical conditions with reasonable proof. Please inform the instructor as early as possible should this happens so we can talk about make-up plans accordingly.

## Resources

### Office hours

By appointment, in my office (R3-230).

### Textbooks and other resources 

No textbook is required. Reference and other reading/technical resources will be available in the corresponding lecture pages.
