# Class project

**Transform your own research project with open science**

Each student **must** design and execute the class project on their own. Ideally, we presume each of you have a research project for your degree program. This project is an excellent place to start. Think about how you can apply the open science practices to your project, then actually do it -- this is what we want to see in the class project. 

Some possible action items include:

- Publish your data in a FAIR-compatible repository
- Write documentation for your code, and publish them altogether
- Make your data analysis workflow fully redistributable and reproducible on the cloud
- Design an easy and inclusive method for scientific data exploration and visualization 
- Submit your paper draft to a preprint server
- Maximize the chance for other people to see your work
- Reach out to people and explain your science

**No idea?**

It is great that you align this class project with your research goals since I believe this is an effecient way to boost the progress in the graduate school. But no worries if you don't have any research projects or want to start fresh! Here are some topics to help you kickstart things. And you are always more than welcome to talk about any ideas with me.

- Design a scientific (perceptually uniform) colormap that also looks beautiful
- Build a GUI for showing glacier velocity on demand
- Publish a workflow that gets all information about a certain earthquake in one place
- Translate documentation of a scientific tool into a new language
- Create a public dashboard showing real-time thermal data for a certain volcano

## Components of the class project

Your class project must contain the following components:

1. A research topic. Can be scientific or technical, but it must be something new. 
2. Highlights of its open science practices. Each project needs at least **two** highlight items.
3. Code or detailed description about achieving these highlights. 
4. Results or final products at the end of the term. 
 
For written reports, You are welcome to use any languages that I understand (中文, English, 台文, & Español). On the other hand, we will stick to English for oral presentations. 

### Progress report

The progress report serves as a checkpoint for the term project. 

#### Write-up (due 4/11 23:59 pm UTC+8)

A short one-pager describing the research topic and the anticipated open science highlights.

**Format requirements:**

- Ideally less than 500 words, including two highlight items.
- Showing just your name with the report will do just fine. 

**How to submit the report?**

You need to export the report to PDF and send the file to me (whyjz@csrsr.ncu.edu.tw). The progress report will *not* be published for public access. Check out the [late policy](syllabus.html#late-work-policy) should you find yourself unable to complete the assignment on time. 

#### Oral presentation (4/13 1-2 pm during the class time)

Each person will spend ten minutes talking about the project, followed by a 5-10 minute discussion. We will determine the presentation order when the class starts. 

**Format requirements**

- Presentation slides or demos are optional. If you need to present with them, bring your own laptop (with an HDMI output) or send the files or links to me (whyjz@csrsr.ncu.edu.tw) before the class starts so we can show your material on the big screen. 
- Presentation should include why you choose this topic, what you will achieve, and what the open science highlights are.

### Final report

#### Oral presentation (6/1)

Presentation with slides and/or demos. Detailed format TBD.

#### Write-up (due 6/8)

Abstract plus the main text should be ideally less than 3000 words (excluding figures, code, and metadata). Will need to be published online for public access, so please do not include any sensitive information such as your student ID. Treat it as a mini-paper; it should have a proper structure as a piece of scientific writing. Abstract, introduction and conclusion are mandatory, and other common sections such as methods, data, and results are highly recommended. We will show you how to submit the written report in the next few weeks (forget about your Microsoft Word!)

In addition to the required [components of the class project](project.html#components-of-the-class-project), consider addressing these key questions in the report as well:

- How do the chosen open science practices help improve your research project?
- How do the chosen open science practices help other people understand your work or collaborate with you?
- What are the future goals of this research project after the semester ends?
- Will you continue to use the chosen open science practices in the future? Why?
