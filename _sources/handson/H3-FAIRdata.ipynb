    "# FAIRly share your data and code \n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will show you how to code with Git and GitHub as preparation for the next hands-on practice. We will also introduce some FAIR-compliant data repositories and explore how they work. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1 | Git\n",
    "\n",
    "Git is an open-source, distributed **version control system**, which means it can manage a project between different versions for speedy and collaborative development. \n",
    "\n",
    "### üõ†Ô∏è Clone a GitHub repository to your working environment\n",
    "\n",
    "üö© **Task:** Go to your [Github](https://github.com/) repository page you created from the last hands-on session. It has this URL convention: `https://github.com/[your_ID]/[your_repository_name]`. Click the green `Code` button to show the clone path. To start simply, we use the HTTPS version with the following naming convention: `https://github.com/[your_ID]/[your_repository_name].git`. We will use this path in the next task.\n",

    "\n",
    "üö© **Task:** Log into [Callysto Hub](https://hub.callysto.ca/) (or other other working environment you prefer). Open a terminal window. The figure below shows how to open it using the [JupyterLab interface](https://whyjz.github.io/ncu-open-science/handson/H1-Jupyter.html#try-callysto). (The blue button with a plus sign in the figure opens the launcher page.)\n",

    "\n",
    "`git clone https://github.com/[your_ID]/[your_repository_name].git`\n",
    "\n",
    "Once done, you should see a new folder in the left panel (file browser) that shows the repository name. You have now copied and linked the repository content from GitHub to Callysto Hub.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ùì **Question:** After you have cloned the repository, navigate (`cd`) to the repository folder and enter the prompt `git status`. What does the resulting message mean? \n",

    "\n",
    "Once you have new content in the repository, we can tell Git to track the change. This is an action called a \"commit.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "üö© **Task:** Create a Notebook file called `commit_test.ipynb` and add the following content to a markdown cell:\n",

    "# Title\n",
    "## Section 1\n",

    "üö© **Task:** If this is your first time committing a change in a new working environment, you will need to configure the following information prior to a commit:\n",
    "\n",
    "````{margin}\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "The third line of the code is optional for the later steps since it just specifies the preferred text editor \"nano\" for commits. If a text editor is not specified, Git will use the system default (which is `vim` on Callysto).\n",

    "‚ùì **Question:** Enter the prompt `git status`. What does the resulting message mean? \n",
    "\n",
    "üö© **Task:** Stage new content by the following command for a commit: (Make sure your terminal is at the root directory of the repository before doing this!) \n",
    "```\n",
    "git add .\n",
    "```\n",
    "‚ùì **Question:** Enter the prompt `git status`. What does the resulting message mean? \n",

    "git commit\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### üõ†Ô∏è Push the changes to GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "Now is the time to update the remote repository with the new changes (aka to \"Push\").\n",
    "\n",
    "üö© **Task:** Create a [Github personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) for the https access security purposes. Either a fine-grained or a classic access token works. I recommend using a fine-grained token first. For permissions, select \"Contents\" and \"Workflows\" and change the access type to \"Read and write\" for both permissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "üö© **Task:** Go back to the repository folder on Callysto Hub and enter the command below in the terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git push\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter your GitHub username and the access token. After the push is done, the new changes (`commit_test.ipynb`) will be available on Github for anyone to check.\n",

    "<!-- Typically we want a new DOI to be associated with the new upload unless there has been other DOI issued to you. If you want to get the DOI before finalizing and publishing the upload, you can choose the \"reserve DOI\" option. **DOI registration is permanent!** You cannot remove/delete a DOI once it is given to your submission. I'll let you decide whether you try this functionaility or not during this session.\n",
