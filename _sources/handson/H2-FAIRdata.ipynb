    "**2023.03.07, 2023.03.14**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Understand how to archive data on Zenodo and make them FAIR-compatible.\n",
    "2. Create a repository on Github and archive the content (which can be data or code) on Zenodo automatically whenever there is a release.\n",
    "\n",
    "## [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)\n",

    "Zenodo is an open repository aiming for hosting all kinds of research materials, including but not limited to data, code, images, presentations, papers, and documentation. Zenodo is operated by [CERN](https://home.cern/) under the EU/EC [OpenAIRE program](https://www.openaire.eu/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal 1 procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "### Register a Zenodo account \n",
    "\n",
    "You can use your Github/ORCID to register a Zenodo account if you have one or are creating one. [What is ORCID?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1Rijk_TMHA)\n",
    "\n",
    "(We'll ask to to create a Github account later during this session.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Attempt to create an Upload \n",
    "\n",
    "During the upload, you'll also be asked to provide a license (if for open access) and deal with a DOI.\n",
    "\n",
    "A license can be given in two ways:\n",
    "1. By choosing one in the dropdown menu\n",
    "2. By including a license file in the uploaded zip file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically we want a new DOI to be associated with the new upload unless there has been other DOI issued to you. If you want to get the DOI before finalizing and publishing the upload, you can choose the \"reserve DOI\" option. **DOI registration is permanent!** You cannot remove/delete a DOI once it is given to your submission. I'll let you decide whether you try this functionaility or not during this session.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have companian material (such as a journal paper or a conference presentation), you can fill in the related/alternate identifiers to link the upload to the companians.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't forget to prepare the other metadata as much complete as possible! This determines how easy the upload to be reused by other people. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## [Github](https://github.com/)\n",

    "Github is an online hosing service for software, code, and documentation using Git as the tool of version control. You don't need to install Git to use Github, and vise versa. However, **I recommend that you use Git along with Github** for a good integration of the data science ecosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal 2 procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume you already have a Github account. If not, it won't take much time to register one ðŸ™‚\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create a Github repository\n",
    "\n",
    "On Github, go to \"Your repositories\" and you'll see the page as below. Click the green button saying \"New.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "![something](figs/Github-scr1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Clone this Github repository to your local machine\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that we will use the [Callysto Hub](https://hub.callysto.ca/) as the local machine, although it's technically on the cloud. \n",
    "\n",
    "`git clone https://github.com/YOUR-ID/YOUR-REPO-NAME.git`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Make commits and push them to Github\n",
    "\n",
    "To use git the first time on a machine, you'll need to configure it. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git config --global user.name \"YOUR NAME\"\n",
    "git config --global user.email \"YOUR.EMAIL@some.domain.edu\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Link the Github repository to Zenodo\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create a release\n",
    "\n",
    "After you create a release, wait for a while (it could take from a few minutes to a few days) and go to Zenodo. Now you should be able to see your repository appeared as an upload with a DOI issued to it!"
