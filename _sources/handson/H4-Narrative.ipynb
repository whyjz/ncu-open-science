    "# Writing narrative science \n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial introduces Jupyter Book, a powerful tool for writing narrative science. I also used it to create the course webpages. The goals of this tutorial are to familiarize yourself with the MyST Markdown and to build and publish a Jupyter Book page using GitHub Pages. \n",

    "## What is narrative science?\n",
    "\n",
    "Like other trendy words in data science, we don't have a common agreement about what it means by narrative science. Here we will use the following definition: narrative science is a concept of writing a piece that provides scientific and technical details in a research project with a narrative (i.e., context-based) structure so that readers can digest all the information in the text without cross-referencing. {cite}`Dahlstrom2014`\n",

    "Jupyter Book coordinates several tools in the Python ecosystem for publishing science and technical writing pieces. Some of the most relevant tools include\n",
    "\n",
    "- [MyST Markdown](https://jupyterbook.org/content/myst.html): a derivative of Markdown, a [markup language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language) allowing users to create rich and formatted text for their documents using a simple text editor. It includes all Jupyter Notebook Markdown syntax and provides more formatting options than the latter.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/): a Python-based engine to read and parse markup-formatted source files and build documents in various formats, including HTML, PDF, and EPUB.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Jupyter Book is also capable of parsing source files provided as Jupyter Notebooks, making it powerful to compile research workflows for publication.\n",
