    "# Writing narrative science \n",
    "\n",
    "**2023.04.18, 2023.04.25**\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will provide introduction to Jupyter Book, a powerful tool for writing narrative science. I also used it to create the course webpages.\n",

    "## What is narrative science?\n",
    "\n",
    "Like other trendy words in data science, we don't have a common agreement about what it means by narrative science. Here we will use the following definition: narrative science is a concept to write a piece that provides scientific and technical details in a research project with a narrative (i.e., context-based) structure so that readers can digest all the information in the text without cross-referencing. {cite}`Dahlstrom2014`\n",
    "\n",
    "We will talk more about this during the lecture discussion.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Familiarize yourself with the MyST Markdown through some practices\n",
    "2. Build and publish a Jupyter Book page on GitHub Pages \n",
    "\n",
    "## [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/)\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- ![Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/_static/logo-wide.svg) -->\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/) package coordinates several tools in the Python ecosystem for publishing science and technical writing pieces. Some of the most relevant tools include\n",
    "\n",
    "- [MyST Markdown](https://jupyterbook.org/content/myst.html): a derivative of Markdown, a [markup language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language) allowing users to create rich and formatted text for their documents using a simple text editor. \n",
    "\n",
    "- [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/): a Python-based engine to read and parse markup-formatted source files and build beautiful documents in various formats, including HTML, PDF, and EPUB.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Jupyter Book is also capable of parse source files provided as Jupyter Notebooks, making it powerful to complie research workflows for publication.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal 1 procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "[Callysto Hub portal](https://hub.callysto.ca/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Go to the test repositry you created in the [previous session](H2-FAIRdata). Create a folder named `jupyter-book` and a new Jupyter Notebook file named `test.ipynb`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Open `test.ipynb` and change the type of the first cell from code to markdown. Copy and paste the following content into that cell:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# This is a title\n",
    "\n",
    "## Section 1\n",
    "\n",
    "## Section 2\n",
    "\n",
    "### Section 2.1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Press `Ctrl+Enter` or `Shift+Enter` to render this cell as Markdown. On Jupyter Lab, the markdown cells are rendered using the [Jupyter Notebook Markdown](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/file-types/notebooks.html), an extension of CommonMark Markdown. \n",
    "\n",
    "MyST Markdown (which Jupyter Book uses to render the markdown content) is a [superset of CommonMark Markdown](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/file-types/markdown.html#extended-markdown-with-myst-markdown), meaning it fully supports Notebook-flavored markdown and provides more functionaility for narrative science.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now I have a few tasks for you for expanding `index.ipynb`: let's see if you can figure this out by searching in the [Jupyter Book documentation](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/content/index.html)!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Display [the following figure](https://whyjz.github.io/ncu-open-science/_static/csrsr_logo.png) in Section 1:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Display the following equation ([Stefanâ€“Boltzmann law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan%E2%80%93Boltzmann_law)) in Section 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "P = \\epsilon \\sigma AT^4\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Display this code snippet in Section 2.1 (do not use another cell!)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "#### This sample code was auto-generated using Bing's ChatGPT AI (GPT-4).\n",

    "\n",
    "4. Add text linking to Section 1. An example is [shown here](narrative_science) (linking to the beginning section of this document).\n",
    "\n",
    "You might not be able to see some of the rendering on the JupyterLab/Notebook GUI; you'll need Jupyter Book to render the MyST markdown correctly. See the next section for details.\n",
